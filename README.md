# SurrealC#

Can I?: 
- [ ] get a surreal db up and running
- [ ] use nothing but C# and some queries to interact with it
- [ ] have all the database logic, schemas, stored procedures, (other usually cryptic and hidden db shit) visible from C# code
- [ ] use a Blazor frontend to connect directly with the db without the need for an api, and without compromising:
  - [ ] security
  - [ ] readability
